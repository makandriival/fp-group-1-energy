# Your Energy

Vite + TypeScript starter for `fp-group-1-energy`. The app uses native browser
APIs and does not use a UI framework.

The static-first layout follows
[vanilla-app-template](https://github.com/yuliialiubenka/vanilla-app-template):
HTML is composed with build-time `<load>` includes, CSS is collected in one
stylesheet, and TypeScript only adds behavior to existing elements.

## Shared code

```

Keep each page and component's TypeScript, HTML, and CSS together in its own
folder. Vite's root is `src`; production files go to `dist`. Include HTML
partials using paths relative to `src` (without a leading `./`), including
inside other partials:

```html
<load src="pages/HomePage/HomePage.html" />
<load
  src="components/Button/Button.html"
  type="submit"
  variant="solid"
  label="Search"
/>
```

The include plugin expands these tags before the browser receives the HTML.
Static arguments in partials use `{=$label}` syntax. For `Icon`, provide
`src-url` and `label` (use an empty label for decorative icons). For
`SearchField`, provide a unique `id`, `label`, and `placeholder`.

Add component/page CSS imports to `src/styles/index.css`. TypeScript should
attach event listeners to existing markup, not import HTML as strings or build
the app with DOM factories. Components and pages without custom behavior keep an
empty TypeScript module (`export {}`), ready for future interactions.
`initSearchFields` binds clear buttons to static search fields; it emits a
native `input` event and restores focus when clearing.

Both pages exist in the delivered HTML. A small hash-change handler toggles
their `hidden` attributes and the navigation's `aria-current`; it never rebuilds
the shell or page content. The Home page is visible without JavaScript. Existing
`#/` and `#/favorites` links (including direct links, refreshes, and browser
back/forward) remain supported. Unknown hashes show Home.

Keep global rules, design tokens, and reusable utilities shared; component and
page styles belong beside their HTML and TypeScript files. Use BEM-style CSS
names and preserve the 768px and 1200px breakpoints. Photos are full-resolution
sources; resize them for delivery when implementing screens. SVGs keep their
original colors and dimensions.

Set `type="button"` for non-submit buttons and `type="submit"` for form
submission. Give icon-only buttons accessible names. Handle and display errors
from `fetchJson`.

## Commits

Hooks install with `npm ci`; run `npm run prepare` if they need reinstalling.
Pre-commit checks staged formatting and lint without rewriting files.

Use Conventional Commits with a title of at most 100 characters:

```text
feat(header): add mobile menu
fix: correct favorites storage
docs: explain local setup
```

Run `npm run check` before opening a PR. GitHub Actions runs the same checks.

## Deployment

Enable **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**. Pushes to `main` deploy
through the Pages workflow.

The app uses hash routes and the `/fp-group-1-energy/` base path. Import assets
from `src/images` in HTML or use the named exports in TypeScript when needed.
Public files remain in the top-level `public` folder: use `%BASE_URL%` in HTML
and `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` in TypeScript for their URLs.
